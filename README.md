# # IGME-201 PE - Bug Hunt

## Objective
Fix all the errors (syntax, runtime and logic) in this program so it runs properly.

## Details
The user is prompted to enter a number. Based on the number they enter the program should print something back to the user.

1. Pick a random number of times to ask the user if they can hear you. Get the user's response and do nothing with it. After you have asked the random number of times stop asking.

1. Ask the user what the speed of light is in meters per second. Check the user's response to the const variable already created and inform the user if they are correct.

1. Add 2 + 2 and print out the result to the user.

1. Set the grade for all students at RIT. Let's be kind and give everyone :tada::100::tada:.

1. Tell the user they missed.

1. Tell the user they hit.

1. Tell the user they got a critical hit.

1. Flip a coin and print out to the user the result.

1. Divide 9 by 3 and output your work.

1. Print out what the user entered.

**Invalid numbers**

Let the user know they entered a wrong number. If they enter "-1" make a sly remark about they trying to break your program.

After you have given the user a response based on what number they entered ask if they are done.

## Sample Correct Run:

> Pick a number 1-10: -1
> Really? You think that will break this perfect program?
> 
> Are you done (y,n)? n
> 
> 
> Pick a number 1-10: 0
> Sorry I can't do anything with that number.
> 
> Are you done (y,n)? n
> 
> 
> Pick a number 1-10: 1
> Can you hear me now?
> Can you hear me now?
> Can you hear me now?
> Can you hear me now?
> Can you hear me now?
> 
> Are you done (y,n)? n
> 
> 
> Pick a number 1-10: 2
> What is the speed of light in m/s? 5
> WRONG!

> What is the speed of light in m/s? 299792458
> That's Right!!!!
> 
> Are you done (y,n)? n
> 
> 
> Pick a number 1-10: 3
